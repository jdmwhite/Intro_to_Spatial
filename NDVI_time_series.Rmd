### Learning objectives
1. Download MODIS vegetation indices
2. Process raster data
3. Produce a summarised time series

### Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into satellite data to better understand patterns of landscape change over space and time. So far, we have explored spatial functions, but dealing with time and dates adds another level of complexity to our analysis. To manage this, we will use several `mapping` or `looping` functions. These functions iterate a function over every element in our list or collection. This is important to learn for many elements of programming (such as in [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)), but becomes extremely useful in collections of satellite data over time.

```

Satellite data can take many forms, but today we will be using passive, optical data collected from the [NASA VIIRS satellite](https://viirsland.gsfc.nasa.gov/Val/VI_Val.html). This satellite works by capturing electromagnetic information reflected from the surface of the earth using sensors. Depending on the sensitivity of the satellite (i.e. the spectral resolution), this information may be captured along different spectral **bands**. Some of these we are familiar with, such as the Red, Green or Blue band. When combining these bands together, they form a 'true' colour image. They also collect spectral information along longer wavelengths, in the infrared range. A band of particular importance to understanding vegetation dynamics is the near-infrared band.

```{r EM spectrum, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='60%', fig.cap='The electromagnetic spectrum, highlighting typical bands used in satellite remote sensing.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/em_spectrum.png")
```

### NDVI

There are certain properties of plants that make these bands useful to us. For example, healthy vegetation reflects more near-infrared (NIR) and green light, but absorbs more red and blue light. This is largely why healthy vegetation looks green to our eyes. Vegetation that is stressed or unhealthy will typically absorb more NIR and reflect more red light, in turn producing different colours, which our eyes may interpret as yellow or brown. 

```{r NDVI visual, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='60%', fig.cap='The relationship between NIR and red bands for healthy (left) and unhealthy (right) vegetation. Source: NASA'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ndvi_example.jpg")
```

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index uses the NIR and red bands to formulate this relationship:
$$
NDVI = \frac{(NIR - red)}{(NIR + red)}
$$
NDVI can provide valuable information on phenology, vegetation productivity, agriculture, or disturbancs such as deforestation, illegal ploughing or wild fires.

From **gisgeography**: "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs)."

NDVI can only fall between -1 and 1. A simplified understanding of NDVI values may say: values greater than 0.6 may indicate healthy vegetation, values lower than 0.6 but greater than 0, may indicate unhealthy vegetation. Values below 0 are likely to be water. Read up more on NDVI at [**gisgeography**](https://gisgeography.com/ndvi-normalized-difference-vegetation-index/), where they explain the calculation and the use of different satellite bands.

```{r NDVI gif over SA, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='60%', fig.cap='NDVI change over South Africa across a single year'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sa_modis.gif")
```

There are many other indices out there for vegetation, water, fire scars and many more. For most satellites, we will need to calculate these indices ourselves. Fortunately, there are also products, such as the MODIS vegetation images, which provide these indices for us. We will use these in our practical. 

### Tutorial

Let's start coding. First install and load packages:

```{r install and load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages('MODISTools')
# install.packages('tidyverse')
# install.packages('terra')
# install.packages('lubridate')

#### Load packages ----
library(MODISTools) # downloading modis data
library(tidyverse) # data manipulation and plotting
library(terra) # raster manipulation
library(lubridate) # dates
```

#### Explore the data

Using the `MODISTools` package, we have direct access to all of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and other (e.g. VIIRS) satellite imagery. This satellite collects data on the atmosphere, land and ocean. Read up more on the land mission [here](https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

We will first load in our area of interest, which is the municipal boundary for the City of Johannesburg.

```{r}
#### Load in our area of interest for later----
coj <- vect("data/land_cover_change/COJ_boundary.shp")
```

Then we will identify all of the products available through `MODISTools`. We will then select the VIIRS product for vegetation indices and explore the available bands. This product gives both Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) every 16 days across the globe at a spatial scale of 500m. Additionally, it provides RGB bands and information on the pixel reliability, which we will both use. 

There are products that produce a finer temporal and spatial resolution, which may suit a study working within a smaller area, but we will not require this here.

```{r Explore the MODIS data}
#### Explore modis products ----
# All products available
products <- mt_products()
head(products)

# bands of the vegetation indices product
bands <- mt_bands(product = "VNP13A1")
head(bands)
```

We can then explore all of the available dates for a location of interest - in this case a central point in Johannesburg.

```{r}
# dates available for a specific coordinate
dates <- mt_dates(product = "VNP13A1", lat = -26.2041, lon = 28.0473)
head(dates)
```

#### Downloading MODIS data

We will now set up the parameters for downloading the vegetation index (VI) data. This requires the product of interest (VIIRS Vegetation Index product), latitude and longitude (Johannesburg) and a start and end date (all of 2021). We can also specify which bands we want, which will make our download faster. Here we take the NDVI band and a pixel reliability band. 

We can also specify an area around the coordinate to download data from. Here we specify 25km left and right (`km_lr`) and 40km above and below (`km_ab`).

```{r Set up parameters for downloading satellite data}
#### Download NDVI data for JHB ----
start_time <- Sys.time()
jhb_ndvi <- mt_subset(product = "VNP13A1",
                          lat = -26.183483,
                          lon =  27.975311,
                          band = c("500_m_16_days_NDVI",
                                   "500_m_16_days_pixel_reliability"),
                          start = "2021-01-01",
                          end = "2021-12-30",
                          km_lr = 25,
                          km_ab = 40,
                          site_name = "JHB",
                          internal = TRUE,
                          progress = TRUE)
end_time <- Sys.time()
# How long does it take to download 200 km2 of VIIRS NDVI data at 500 m resolution for 2 bands?
end_time - start_time
```

Impressively, this only took 1.5 minutes to download 46 images overe 200 km2. An interesting feature of the `MODISTools` package, is that it downloads data as a `data.frame`. This makes it easy to manipulate and immediately visualise using data wrangling tools in the `tidyverse`. It is still a big data frame (~1.5 million rows) - so let's filter and summarise it down a bit.

#### Plot time series

Our aim is to produce a single median NDVI value for each unique date and plot it. Importantly, we need to rescale the NDVI data using the value in the `scale` column.

```{r summarise data}
# Summarise
jhb_ndvi %>% 
  filter(band == "500_m_16_days_NDVI") %>%
  group_by(calendar_date) %>%
  summarise(doy = yday(as_date(calendar_date)),
            ndvi_median = median(value * as.numeric(scale))) %>% 
  distinct(doy, .keep_all = TRUE) -> jhb_med_ndvi
head(jhb_med_ndvi)

# Plot
ggplot(jhb_med_ndvi, aes(x = doy, y = ndvi_median)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  labs(x = 'Day of Year', y = 'NDVI (median)') +
  theme_classic() 
```

In very few lines of code - we already have a time series plot!

This clearly shows the seasonal pattern of the (southern hemisphere) summer rainfall pattern of Johannesburg. The NDVI peaks in December/January and is lowest in July/August just before the rains begin. You may notice that in February there is a very odd, outlying observation. Let's convert the data frame to rasters to explore this a bit further.

Before we move on let's save the plot to file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Save plot
ggsave('output/figs/ndvi_time_series/jhb_med_ndvi.png',
       width = 120, height = 80, units = c('mm'), dpi = 'retina', bg = 'white')
```

#### Convert NDVI data frame to rasters

To convert the data frame to rasters, we will first split up the large data frame into many smaller ones and store them in a list. 

To do this, we first filter to only include our NDVI band and then use the `split()` function by each `date`. The output of this is a large list with 46 seperate data frames - one for each date.

```{r split df}
# filter to NDVI and then split the data frame into a list by date
jhb_ndvi_split <- jhb_ndvi %>% filter(band == "500_m_16_days_NDVI") %>% split(jhb_ndvi$calendar_date)
```

We can now convert each data frame to a raster using the built in `MODISTools` function `mt_to_raster()`. We nest this function inside a call to `terra::rast()`, which converts the `mt_to_raster()` output into a `terra` style `SpatRast`, which is easier to manipulate.

We put this all inside the `lapply()` function, which will `loop` this function over each element of our list. The output is another list, but this time full of rasters.

```{r convert ndvi to rast}
# convert each date into a raster (and reproject)
jhb_ndvi_rast_list <- lapply(jhb_ndvi_split, function(x) {terra::rast(mt_to_raster(x, reproject = TRUE))})
```

Using the `terra::rast()` function again, we can now convert this list of rasters into a **raster stack**. This **stack** can then be easily manipulated, like masking the pixels to only be inside our area of interest - Johannesburg.

```{r}
# convert the list of rasters into a raster stack
jhb_ndvi_rasts <- rast(jhb_ndvi_rast_list)
jhb_ndvi_rasts <- mask(jhb_ndvi_rasts, coj)
```

Let's now visualise our odd outlying date. We will plot both the first image and the image on the 25th of January using the `terra::plot()` function, which is an easy way to quickly view our data.

```{r}
# plot out two dates
plot(jhb_ndvi_rasts$`2021-01-01`, main = '2021-01-01')
plot(coj, add = T)
plot(jhb_ndvi_rasts$`2021-01-25`, main = '2021-01-25')
plot(coj, add = T)
```

We can clearly see that there is something odd in our second image. Large portions have very low NDVI values. Can you think of why this may be the case?

Let's explore this further using the pixel reliability index.

#### Convert Pixel Reliability to raster

We will repeat the same steps as we did above for the NDVI band, but this time filter the data to only the pixel reliability band. We will end by plotting out 3 dates: our first image, 25th of January and then an image from June (in the dry winter months).

```{r}
# filter to pixel reliability band and then split the data frame into a list by date
jhb_pr_split <- jhb_ndvi %>% filter(band == "500_m_16_days_pixel_reliability") %>% split(jhb_ndvi$calendar_date)

# convert each date into a raster (and reproject)
jhb_pr_rast_list <- lapply(jhb_pr_split, function(x) {rast(mt_to_raster(x, reproject = TRUE))})

# convert the list of rasters into a raster stack
jhb_pr_rasts <- rast(jhb_pr_rast_list)
jhb_pr_rasts <- mask(jhb_pr_rasts, coj)

# plot out a few dates
plot(jhb_pr_rasts$`2021-01-01`, main = '2021-01-01')
plot(jhb_pr_rasts$`2021-01-25`, main = '2021-01-25')
# these are unreliable images
plot(jhb_pr_rasts$`2021-06-18`, main = '2021-06-18') # this is a reliable image
# scores below 3 are acceptable
```

We can immediately see that images 1 and 2 have very high scores (above 3). Any value above 3 is likely to be an unreliable pixel. Our last image most has values below 3. 

An ideal workflow from here would be to filter NDVI pixel out with an unreliable pixel score. We won't do it here, but keep this in mind if you are getting strange outliers. 

#### Plot RGB

To better visualise this, we will now plot the true colour image using the red, green and blue bands for a limited region (20 km each direction of our point of interest) and for a single date (25th January 2021). We download and process our new data in the same way as before:

```{r}
# Using the same dataset, now download the red, green and blue bands to plot a true colour image for just the 25th January 2021
jhb_rgb <- mt_subset(product = "VNP13A1",
                     lat = -26.183483,
                     lon =  27.975311,
                     band = c("500_m_16_days_red_reflectance",
                               "500_m_16_days_green_reflectance",
                               '500_m_16_days_blue_reflectance'),
                      start = "2021-01-25",
                      end = "2021-01-25",
                      km_lr = 20,
                      km_ab = 20,
                      site_name = "JHB",
                      internal = TRUE,
                      progress = TRUE)

# Split the data frame again, this time by band instead of calendar_date
jhb_rgb_split <- split(jhb_rgb, jhb_rgb$band)

# convert to raster and reproject
jhb_rgb_rasts <- lapply(jhb_rgb_split, function(x) {rast(mt_to_raster(x, reproject = TRUE))})

# combine the rasters together
jhb_rgb_rast <- c(jhb_rgb_rasts[[1]], jhb_rgb_rasts[[2]], jhb_rgb_rasts[[3]])

# We can now use the plotRGB function to plot a true colour image
plotRGB(jhb_rgb_rast, stretch = 'hist')
plot(coj, add = TRUE)
```

You may have guessed it by now and it is obvious to see that there is a massive cloud in the middle of our image! Clouds are a serious issue in optical remote sensing and can easily throw off NDVI measures. The MODIS and VIIRS products try to account for this by averaging data over a 16-day time period. But even then in areas with lots of cloud cover, like Johannesburg in its rainy summer and frequently in the tropics, this is a recurring issue. So keep this in mind when handling optical satellite imagery and remember to filter these out if the issues are severe using either pixel reliability measures or cloud-masking methods.

#### Download NDVI for multiple sites

We will now move onto download NDVI data for multiple sites. To do this, we need to create or import a data frame with lat/lon coordinates for each site. You can import this as a csv file. The function we will use is `MODISTools::mt_batch_subset()`. This requires your data frame to have a `lat`, `lon` and `site_name` column. Rename your variables using `names(df) <- c('site_name', 'lat', 'lon')` if they have different names. We will quickly create a data frame in R, using lat/lon coordinates for 3 cities: Johannesburg, Accra and Nairobi. 

We the use the `mt_batch_subset()` function and use a buffer of only 2km each direction for each city and extract only the NDVI values for 2021. 

```{r batch download}
# Batch download
# Create a dataframe of sites and lat/lon or load in a csv
lat <- c(-26.2041, 5.6037, -1.2921)
lon <- c(28.0473, -0.1870, 36.8219)
site_name <- c('JHB', 'ACC', 'NAI')
coords <- data.frame(site_name, lat, lon)
coords

# Use the mt_batch_subset function to load in data for multiple points
cities_ndvi <- mt_batch_subset(df = coords,
                      product = "VNP13A1",
                      band = c("500_m_16_days_NDVI"),
                      start = "2021-01-01",
                      end = "2021-12-30",
                      km_lr = 2,
                      km_ab = 2,
                      internal = TRUE)
```

For the amount of data we are downloading this works amazingly quickly! 

We can then summarise the data by city (site) and the date (calendar_date) and pipe `%>%` this directly into a `ggplot()`. Note that we use `facet_grid(cols = vars(site))` in the `ggplot()` to create a separate plot for each city.

```{r plot batch}
# Summarise the values by site and date and pipe this directly into a ggplot call
# Use facets to display a smoothed NDVI curve for each site
cities_ndvi %>%
  group_by(site, calendar_date) %>%
  summarise(doy = yday(as_date(calendar_date)),
            ndvi_median = median(value * as.numeric(scale))) %>%
  distinct(doy, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = doy, y = ndvi_median)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.8, alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_smooth(method = 'loess', col = 'darkgreen') +
    labs(x = 'Day of Year', y = 'NDVI (median)') +
    theme_classic() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(site))
```

And remember to save the plot:

```{r}
# Save plot
ggsave('output/figs/ndvi_time_series/cities_med_ndvi.png',
       width = 180, height = 80, units = c('mm'), dpi = 'retina', bg = 'white')
```

That is essentially the end of the learning objectives for this tutorial. However, it is great to use time series data in presentations and to best illustrate this, it can be useful to animate our plots. Scroll down to the bonus section to see how this can be done:

#### Animate time series

```{r}

ndvi_rast_agg <- aggregate(jhb_ndvi_rasts, 5)
# Convert it to a data frame and pivot to a long df
rast_df <- as.data.frame(ndvi_rast_agg, xy = T) %>% pivot_longer(cols = 3:48, names_to = 'Date', values_to = 'NDVI')

#### Extra resources for using NDVI in R

The [`terra` chapter](https://rspatial.org/terra/modis/index.html) in the [rspatial book](https://rspatial.org/) has lots of excellent tutorials on the theory and application of the `terra` package in R. Find more information on `MODISTools` [here](https://jepsonnomad.github.io/tutorials/MODISTools_Intro.html) and [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1273)
